            <h2 id="title-1">Premise</h2>
            <p>Sex Education primarily follows Otis Milburn, a student at Moordale Secondary School. Otis begins the series ambivalent about sex, in part because his single mother, Jean, is a sex therapist who frequently has affairs with male suitors but does not maintain romantic relationships.</p>
            <p>Other students at Moordale include Eric Effiong, Otis's best friend and the gay son of Ghanaian-Nigerian immigrants; Maeve Wiley, a highly intelligent, rebellious teen with a troubled family past; Adam Groff, the headmaster's son who develops a bullying nature out of his own self-loathing; Jackson Marchetti, the head boy struggling to meet the high expectations set for him; Ruby Matthews, Anwar Bakshi, and Olivia Hanan, members of a popular clique known as "the Untouchables"; Aimee Gibbs, an Untouchable who secretly befriends Maeve; and Lily Iglehart, a writer of alien erotica who is determined to lose her virginity. The school is later joined by Ola Nyman, whose widowed father, Jakob Nyman, begins a relationship with Jean.</p>
            <p>In the first series, Otis sets up a sex therapy clinic with Maeve to help the students of Moordale with their sexual problems. Their business becomes a success, but conflict arises when Otis finds himself becoming attracted to Maeve.</p>
            <p>In the second series, new students arrive and challenge the status quo at Moordale, including Ola, who becomes Otis's first girlfriend. Eric helps his former bully Adam come to terms with his sexuality. Jean becomes the school's resident sex therapist as a chlamydia outbreak causes the teens to question and struggle with topical issues.</p>
            <p>In the third series, a new school year begins as Otis enters a relationship with Ruby, Jean expects a baby in the near future, Eric and Adam are made official, and new headmistress Hope Haddon's plans for a major revamp at Moordale cause an extra set of complications for the students.</p>
            <p>In the fourth series, Otis, Eric and most of the former students at Moordale adjust to the new term at Cavendish Sixth Form College, while Maeve begins her studies at Wallace University in the United States.</p>

               <h3>Setting and aesthetics</h3>
               <p>The setting of Sex Education appears to be modern-day Britain, in the fictional village of Moordale, with various elements that serve to place the show in an uncertain time and location. Modern technology, such as smartphones, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with most cars featured ranging from the 1970s to the 1990s. Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s aesthetics rather than modern-day police cars. The show heavily features older technologies such as CRT televisions and dated household appliances. The décor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s décor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s–2000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern décor with a modern, "American-style" fridge. Moordale Secondary School shows some elements of UK secondary schools but also has a more American high school image. According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and a homage to the 1980s films of John Hughes.</p>

            <h2 id="title-5">Style</h2>
            <p>Sex Education is often noted for its unique visual language and aesthetics, which employs American teen culture tropes into a British setting. Inspired by the filmography of John Hughes and the teen comedies of the 1980s, the series incorporates several elements, motifs and designs evocative of those films, and American teen media in general, such as students idling around lockers, non-uniform school dress codes and students sporting letterman jackets. In an interview with British GQ, series director Ben Taylor said: "When [Laurie Nunn] was writing the script and the world, they tended to be on the whole more American references to the school experience I've seen in film and TV than any British ones. There was a tone in the script that was about warmth and positivity. It was just a sort of rendering the school experience as a positive thing, which we tend not to do in this country. I think it also visually elevates it to a slightly more expansive canvas". On the series retrograde setting, notably reminiscent of the 1980s, Taylor explained: "It was always contemporary [...] It was just something we chose not foreground so much, so that it wasn't about a generation of kids who are obsessed with their phones".</p>
